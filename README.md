# LockMe

A tiny iOS app that locks the screen. The lock button on [@niqui's](http://twitter.com/niqui) iPhone 5 isn't working properly, so this is a simply workaround.

It uses a private framework (`GraphicsServices`) so it cannot be submitted to the App Store. It loads the framework dynamically in order to avoid a complicated project setup.
